      <h2>Current Status Quo</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Employee surveys usually happen once a year—if that</li>
        <li>Results come too late and inspire little change</li>
        <li>Participation struggles to hit 85%</li>
        <li>Employees don’t trust them to matter</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional surveys are one-sided. They serve leadership, not employees. Engagement is forced,
        outcomes are minimal, and trust erodes. Morale drops further every time results are ignored.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Ping?</h2>
      <p>
        Ping makes surveys fun, fast, and fair. It’s grounded in behavioral science, designed for habit,
        and built to strengthen trust—not break it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One quick question per day</li>
        <li>Shared results with the team</li>
        <li>Grounded in psychological insights</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        Every morning, Ping asks one playful, powerful question before work begins. That’s it.
        AI picks questions for maximum insight and engagement. 250 questions a year = 250 data points
        for each employee.
